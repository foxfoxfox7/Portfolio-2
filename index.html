				<p class="description">At Queen Mary I joined an intensely active debate on how our planet's photosynthetic organisms regulate their energy consumption. Both plant and bacteria aim to maximise efficiency during low light conditions while protecting themselves from excess energy absorbtion during high light.<br><br>My role in this was to model the most abundant light harvesting protein and to calculate energy pathway probabilities. I was able to give compelling evidence for an emerging theory of light regulation.<br><br>Knowledge of this process has already been used to start growing crops with an increased yield. Innovations such as this are essential if we are to sustainably feed the world's growing population without a decline in soil quality.</p>

				<p class="description">At Charles, my work took on a more fundamental nature. I went to the Czech Republic to lead a project investiating how energy moves in biological organisms. Since a seminal paper in 2007, there has been much investigation into quantum effects in biological organisms. I gave talks at a number of international conferences, discussing the viability of this and how these effects might relate to key biological processes.<br><br>Energy transfer is an integral part of many important biological functions: it travels down nerves as we think and as we move, it is absorbed in the eyes to enable us to see and it is used by plants and bacteria all over the globe, producing oxygen through photosynthesis. Understanding what happens to the energy enables us to develop medicines, engineer 'intelligent' light harvesting devices, it could even be crucial in our fight against climate change.</p>

				<p class="description">After reaching out and working on a volunteer project to investigate the changing ecological conditions of a set of important UK sites, I was offered to join the Natural England team on a fixed term contract.<br><br>Much of the talk around environmental protection has centred around climate change and our need to reduce greenhouse gasses. However, equally important is our need to sustain biodiversity in our natural spaces. Biodiverstiy is nature's energy barrier, protecting it from changing weather conditions and key species loss. Modern agriculture relies on this stability but we are losing biodiversity year by year.<br><br>I worked with extensive recorded data on air quality, soil quality, and plant and animal biodiversity to investigate how our natural spaces are changes. This has enabled Natural England to make rapid changes to their ecological management practices according to the specific needs of sites all over the UK, encouraging an increase of biodiversity.</p>

				<p class="proj_des des">During my work I have met and talked with many healthcare researchers: people passionate about understanding the human body and developing new medicines. It was my goal to contribute but the more I thought about it, the more I came to the conclusion that glamorous work such as identifying tumours from brain scans is not the only way to save lives. Maximising the efficiency of the adminstrative side is just as important and so I set out to learn the ins and outs of the healthcare industry.<br><br><a class="int_links" href="healthcare.html">What better way to learn than by investigating myself.</a></p>
